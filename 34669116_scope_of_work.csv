Narrative Description,"This project will require a fairly large clean out before starting the rehab.  Once cleared out, this will be mostly cosmetic, nothing structurally needs to be fixed or changed.  All bathrooms and kitchens will stay where they are.  This house is all original and needs to be brought up to 2024 standards.  Roof is only 10 years old, along with the mechanicals.  Windows are mostly original so they will need to be swapped out.  Landscaping has deteriorated over time and will also be a big focus on the exterior.  This is a very nice and established location on the north east side of Indianapolis.",
